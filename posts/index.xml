      <description>Prison Life development diaries inauguration Hello!, this is the first dev diary post, and I think that a good start could be introducing Prison Life to you!
Prison Life is the title of an upcoming game made by a single person right now that simulates a life inside a prison.
It can be categorized as a Multiplayer Role Playing game with turn based fighting mechanics.
I do not want to store personal information of the real people playing so i might come up with some kind of anonymous player creation with some limits to avoid abuses.</description>
