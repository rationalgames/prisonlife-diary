				<p>Good afternoon from your future prison!</p>
<p>I know you are going to be assigned to a cell soon!
Me, the warden, and some officers have been looking the news and seems that we have some business to do!</p>
<p>Alright, before giving you the new clothes remember the following steps!</p>
<h2 id="signup">Signup</h2>
<p>Very important! create your user and choose a password.</p>
<p>This step will give you an automatically generated API KEY.
Please, remember this data together with your API Key (needed to use game API)</p>
<h2 id="view-your-user">View your user</h2>
<p>Ensure that the signup is all good!
you can change your password or regenerate your API key from there.</p>
<p>If you loose your API key, or gets stolen, you can regenerate another one.</p>
<p>WARNING! Do not forget your user or password or you will loose your account&hellip;
and we are not able to recover it since we do not store any email or contact from you!</p>
<p>Any account not used in many months will be automatically removed!</p>
<p>REMEMBER: This game is anonymous!</p>
<p>After you have your user, you can play!</p>
<h2 id="character-creation">Character creation</h2>
<p>We just need to know your name prisoner! you will get assigned to a cellblock automatically.</p>
<h2 id="your-first-day-in-prison">Your first day in prison</h2>
<p>As soon as you are assigned to your cell you can familiarize with common actions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>View your character: all useful information about you and where are you located.</li>
<li>Enter or leave your cell: you need to leave your cell to do interesting stuff, or stay in to be safe.</li>
<li>Move to different area: explore the prison.</li>
<li>Look for fights: PVP or PVE!</li>
<li>Start a fight or join ongoing one!: choose rival/team wisely!</li>
<li>View your fight: once you are in a fight, follow the turns using this section</li>
<li>Observe fights: Past fights or other peoples fights can be observed!</li>
<li>Improve skills: You have several skills&hellip; fight to gain experience and improve them afterwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now.</p>
<p>More details after your first shower! :D</p>
