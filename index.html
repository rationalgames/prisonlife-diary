		Good day! time to wake up!
This is the first dev diary post, and I think that a good start could be introducing Prison Life to you!
Prison Life is going to be your life in prison, so get ready!
It can be categorized as a Multiplayer Role Playing game with a turn based fighting mechanics.
I do not want to store personal information of the real people playing, so I might come up with some kind of anonymous player creation with some limits to avoid abuses.
