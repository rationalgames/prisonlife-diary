In order to try out the alpha release of the API:

## Create your user

You can use the Signup POSTMAN request, or manually with curl...
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://static.133.34.69.159.clients.your-server.de:8443/user/<your-user-here>/<your-password-here>'
```

This call will give you back this response

```
{
    "data": {
        "type": "user",
        "id": "test",
        "attributes": {

                "You can regenerate your API key any time from your user profile section",
                "To play the game you must add the PrisonLifeKey header with your API key as the value in each request"
