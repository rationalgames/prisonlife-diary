# Prison Life development diaries inauguration

Hello!, this is the first dev diary post, and I think that a good start could be introducing Prison Life to you!

Prison Life is the title of an upcoming game made by a single person right now that simulates a life inside a prison.

It can be categorized as a Multiplayer Role Playing game with turn based fighting mechanics.

I do not want to store personal information of the real people playing so i might come up with some kind of anonymous player creation with some limits to avoid abuses.

It all starts with YOU being a prisoner and fighting to survive.

I would like to welcome you, as a new inmate and wish a very confortable stay :)

In the upcoming posts I will explain a bit, the current game mechanics.
