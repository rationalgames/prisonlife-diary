Good day! time to wake up!

This is the first dev diary post, and I think that a good start could be introducing Prison Life to you!

Prison Life is going to be your life in prison, so get ready!

It can be categorized as a Multiplayer Role Playing game with a turn based fighting mechanics.

I do not want to store personal information of the real people playing, so I might come up with some kind of anonymous player creation with some limits to avoid abuses.

It all starts with you, obeying the guards orders and me, your WARDEN. You can fight or collaborate with your inmates.

I would like to welcome you, as a new inmate and wish a very comfortable stay :)

In the upcoming posts I will explain a bit what are you going to be able to do...

That's all for now!

Sincerely, your Warden.
