Good afternoon from your future prison!

I know you are going to be assigned to a cell soon! 
Me, the warden, and some officers have been looking the news and seems that we have some business to do!

Alright, before giving you the new clothes remember the following steps!

## Signup
Very important! create your user and choose a password.

This step will give you an automatically generated API KEY. 
Please, remember this data together with your API Key (needed to use game API)

## View your user
Ensure that the signup is all good! 
you can change your password or regenerate your API key from there.

If you loose your API key, or gets stolen, you can regenerate another one.

WARNING! Do not forget your user or password or you will loose your account... 
and we are not able to recover it since we do not store any email or contact from you!

Any account not used in many months will be automatically removed!

REMEMBER: This game is anonymous!

After you have your user, you can play!

## Character creation
We just need to know your name prisoner! you will get assigned to a cellblock automatically.

## Your first day in prison
As soon as you are assigned to your cell you can familiarize with common actions like:
* View your character: all useful information about you and where are you located.
* Enter or leave your cell: you need to leave your cell to do interesting stuff, or stay in to be safe.
* Move to different area: explore the prison.
* Look for fights: PVP or PVE!
* Start a fight or join ongoing one!: choose rival/team wisely!
* View your fight: once you are in a fight, follow the turns using this section
* Observe fights: Past fights or other peoples fights can be observed!
* Improve skills: You have several skills... fight to gain experience and improve them afterwards.

That's all for now.

More details after your first shower! :D
